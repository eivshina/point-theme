## PhD admissions

I wrote a comprehensive guide on STEM Ph.D. admissions in the US that you can purchase [here](https://buy.stripe.com/28og0Q35Y2dbbtK3cy). With this guide, you'll be able to access all that you need to craft a strong application. The guide walks you through the entire admissions process, including 1) what the admissions committee is looking for; 2) program research (where to apply, funding, contacting potential Ph.D. advisors); 3) application timeline; 4) writing an impactful statement of purpose; 4) requesting recommendation letters; 5) drafting a strong CV; 6) GPA and test score requirements. Filled with practical tips, this guide will help you build a solid Ph.D. application that will set you apart!
