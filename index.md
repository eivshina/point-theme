Hi! I'm Katya, an incoming Applied Math PhD student at Harvard supported by the NSF graduate research fellowship and the Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Prize fellowship. Currently, I am a Mathematics senior at Princeton. On campus, I co-founded and ran "02.24.2022" student organization and [Momentum 4 Ukraine](https://momentumai.org/momentum4ukraine) tutoring program for Ukrainian refugee students. I am interested in topological and geometric machine learning. Previosuly, I pursued interdisciplinary computational research in knot theory, machine learning, astrophysics, language, and music.
